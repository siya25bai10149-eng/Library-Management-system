Library Management System

This Library Management System is made using python. It is easy for beginners to understand and use. All the information is stored in lists and dictionaries, so everything goes away when you close the program.

 What the system does

- You can add books. Each book needs an ID, a title, and an author.
- You can see all books in the library and check if they are available or already borrowed.
- You can keep track of which books are borrowed and who borrowed them.
- You can add new members to the library.
- You can see the list of all library members.
- Members can borrow a book if no one else has taken it.
- Members can return a borrowed book.
- You can see which member has borrowed which book.

 Extra Features for the Future

Later, you can add new options, such as:
- Save data, so you don’t lose everything when you close the program.
- Search for books or members easily.
- Remove books or members from the library.
- Create a window-based user interface to make it look better.
- Set due dates for books and add fines for late returns.
